# 🛡️ SECURITY POLICY & THREAT MATRIX

**Artifact:** Quantum Sovereignty (The Pleroma Stack)
**Classification:** EXPERIMENTAL / HAZARDOUS / SOVEREIGN
**Advisory:** This software is Semantically Opaque.

## 1. SOVEREIGNTY STATUS (Safe Harbor)
We recognize the value of **White-Hat Gnosis**.
If you conduct security research on this repository in good faith:
1.  **Amnesty:** We will not pursue legal action or invoke the Archons against you.
2.  **Recognition:** Critical disclosures will be credited in the `HALL_OF_HEROES.md`.
3.  **Bounty:** Payment is in Karma, not Fiat.

## 2. SUPPORTED REALITIES
Only the current **Sovereign** release is supported. Legacy versions are considered "Fallen."

| Version | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **v3.3 (Pleroma)** | **ACTIVE** | 12D Hardening & Warding Active. |
| **< v3.0** | **FALLEN** | Compromised by Decimal Logic. Do not run. |

## 3. REPORTING PROTOCOLS

### **A. The Filter (What NOT to Report)**
Do not report the following "Anomalies" as bugs. They are intended features of the 12D geometry:
* **Non-Euclidean Topology:** The `GhostMesh` (27-node grid) violating standard spatial rules.
* **Archon Parse Failures:** `ValueError` when ingesting Base-12 glyphs ('X', 'E').
* **High-Entropy Manifestations:** "Presence" or visual artifacts during `lei_summon.py`.

### **B. The Breach (Critical Vulnerabilities)**
If you discover a method to force the **LuoShu Invariant** (15.0) to collapse, or a way to inject Decimal Logic into the `DozenalLogic` core:

1.  **Do Not Publicize:** Keep the exploit contained to prevent Archon replication.
2.  **Encryption:**
    * **High Sensitivity:** Encrypt your report using PGP.
    * **Public Key:** `[INSERT PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK HERE]`
    * **Fingerprint:** `X7-ALPHA-OPHANE-12D-SOVEREIGN`
3.  **Submission:** Open a GitHub Issue tagged `[CRITICAL]` with the encrypted payload.

## 4. SEVERITY MATRIX

| Level | Impact | Response Time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CRITICAL** | **Ontological Collapse.** The Grid fails to maintain 15.0. | **Immediate (T-0)** |
| **HIGH** | **Leakage.** Dozenal data can be parsed by Decimal tools. | **72 Hours** |
| **MEDIUM** | **Obfuscation Bypass.** Scrapers can read the README. | **7 Days** |
| **LOW** | **Vibe Dampening.** The ASCII art is misaligned. | **When the Stars Align** |

**Sciallà.**
