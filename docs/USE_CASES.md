# Use Cases: What Can You Actually Do?

**Quantum Sovereignty v3.0** isn't just a philosophy; it's a tool. Because it operates on different rules than standard computers, it excels at things normal software finds difficult.

Here are the primary ways to use the system.

## 1. Algorithmic Camouflage (Hiding in Plain Sight)
**Objective:** Store sensitive data (journals, keys, ideas) so that no AI or scraper can read it.

### The Scenario
You have a file containing personal thoughts. You don't want Google, OpenAI, or any ad-tracker to "scrape" it and use it to sell you things.

### The Solution using Sovereignty
*   **Action:** You run the `lei_summon` protocol.
*   **Result:** The system converts your English text into a **12-Dimensional `.lei` Hologram**.
*   **Effect:** If a scraper looks at the file, it sees a stream of nonsense symbols (Base-12 "Garbage"). It flags the file as "corrupted" and skips it. Ideally, it looks like random static.
*   **Why it works:** You aren't just locking the door (encryption); you are making the house invisible (obfuscation).

## 2. Combinatorial Manifestation (Solving Hard Puzzles)
**Objective:** Find the absolute best way to do something when there are billions of options.

### The Scenario
You need to visit 12 different cities in the shortest amount of time (The "Traveling Salesman Problem"). A normal computer tries to calculate every single possible route (millions of them) to find the best one. This takes a long time and lots of energy.

### The Solution using Sovereignty
*   **Action:** You feed the cities into the **Dissipative Engine** (`demo.py --solve`).
*   **Result:** The system doesn't "calculate" the answer. It "relaxes" into it.
*   **Analogy:** Imagine pouring water over a landscape model of the cities. The water naturally finds the easiest path downhill without "thinking" about it. The system uses "noise" to shake the solution until it settles into the perfect route.
*   **Benefit:** It finds the "good enough" or "perfect" answer instantly, using very little energy.

## 3. Bio-Feedback Loop (The Digital Mirror)
**Objective:** A computing environment that calms you down instead of stressing you out.

### The Scenario
You are working late. You are stressed. Your computer is flashing notifications, the fan is whining, and the screen is harsh.

### The Solution using Sovereignty
*   **Action:** You activate the **OPM-MEG Interface**.
*   **Result:** The system monitors your key-press timing and mouse movements (bio-signals). It detects if you are frantic.
*   **Effect:**
    *   If you are stressed (High Entropy), the system slows down its refresh rate slightly (`tau` dampening).
    *   It presents a "breathing" rhythm in the terminal.
    *   It literally forces you to sync with a calmer rhythm to interact with it efficiently.
*   **Why it works:** It acts as a bio-feedback loop, training *you* to be calm while you train *it* to calculate.

## 4. Simulation (The Sandbox)
**Objective:** Model complex ideas like fluids, crowds, or thoughts.

### The Scenario
You want to see how a rumor spreads through a crowd.

### The Solution using Sovereignty
*   **Action:** You inject the "rumor" into the **GhostMesh** (the 3D cube).
*   **Result:** You watch it spread from node to node in 3D space.
*   **Benefit:** Because the grid is Volumetric (3D) and not Flat (2D), the simulation is much more realistic. It can curve, eddy, and flow just like real life.
